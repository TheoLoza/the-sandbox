NODE JS SECTION

Running js file in node: enter 'node <filename>'
Helpful tool when working with node: nodemon (install using npm)
Very nice framework: Express.js
Express handles routing, templates, etc

TEMPLATING: Taking html files and replacing key sections with data that we will fill using JS.
Replace the data content in html with a placeholder, make sure it's a unique format. Ex: {%PRICE%}

EVERYTHING IS A REQUEST IN NODE.JS!
